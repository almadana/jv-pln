# NLP for ECOSud Project - "Jules Verne"

Self explanatory 'data' and 'scripts' folders.


## Library requirements

To review and edit the alignments, and to extract pitch and formant data we used Praat (6.1.38)

Here's an incomplete list of all the python libraries:

- MFA - Montreal Force Alignment (2.0). (Separate python environment encouraged). 

`conda config --add channels conda-forge`

`conda install montreal-forced-aligner`

After installation, download the english model and dictionary: 

`mfa models download acoustic english_mfa`

`mfa models download dictionary english_mfa`

- Torch (1.11.0) - `pip install torch`

- Transformers (4.20.0) - from HuggingFace. `pip install transformers`

- Whisper () - `pip install openai-whisper`



## RoBERTa embeddings

Semantic unpredictability was estimated using a RoBERTa maasked language model as follows ("roberta-base"). Masked language models are trained to estimate the probability of any given word to occur at a specified  place in text. For each word, a masked content sentence was created including the previous 520 words in the transcription, and replacing the target word with a special '<mask>' token. The masked sentence was then fed to the model, which estimated the probability distribution for each token in the vocabulary to appear in place of the mask. The unpredictability value was calculated as 1 minus the esimated probability of the target word divided by the maximum probability value in the distribution.

## Analysis pipeline

- Transcribe audio .wav files with Whisper.

Example:

`whisper trial01.wav --language en --model medium --output_dir ./ --output_format json `

this might take a while... try "--model small" instead and check results

all files at once:

`for i in {01..16}; do whisper trial$i.wav --language en --model medium --output_dir ./ --output_format json; done` 


- Run process_json.py to extract json files to plain text

- Manually inspect and modify transcription plain text files if necessary (it probably is). Make sure these files have ONLY ONE LINE of text!!

- Move revised plain text files to the "wavfiles" folder in 'data'. Rename them to match the name of each wavefile (keep the .txt extension). The structure should be something like `./data/wavfiles/trial{01..11}.{txt,wav}`

- (Separate python environment encouraged) Run mfa to validate and align transcriptions to wav files. 

Example: 

`mfa validate ./wav english_mfa english_mfa`

`mfa align --clean ./wav english_mfa english_mfa ./wav/aligned `


- Open each wav and textGrid file with Praat and revise for inconsistencies and misalignments (if you want a complete annotation of all the phonemes, that's going to take some work...)

- Save the revised `textGrid` files to the `./revised` subfolder. Change the file encoding from UFT-16 to UtF-8 (using Kate, Notepad++ or your favourite plain text editor)

- Run `embed_main.py`

- There should be now a file named `embed.mat` in the data folder

    The structure is as follows:
    
    - A n-by-1 cell array with each filename
    
    - A n-by-1 cell array with morphoeme markings. Each cell contains a timepoints-by-2 matrix. onset and offset are the columns
    
    - A cell array with morphemes. Each cell contains a char-array of timepoints-by-width, where width is the max number of characters (uses right-padding). Ideally should be one... but maybe not
    
    - A cell array with prediction "probabilities". Each cell contains a timepoints-by-3 matrix: onset, offset and "prob" and the columns.
    
    - A n-by-1 cell array with the text markings. Each cell contains a char-array of timepoints-by-width, where width is the max number of characters (uses right-padding).
        
To obtain pitch and forman data from the audio files:

- Open all audio files in Praat (all at once if you're feeling lucky)

- Open the pitch_extractor.praat script

- Run the script once for each audio file (you should write the name of the corresponding Sound object as it appears on the list, but without the number. For instance: Sound renard1)

- You can provide a corresponding output filename (renard_pitch.csv)

- I'm not sure where Praat is going to create each output file. Probably in either a) the Home folder, or b) the last folder in which you saved a file during this session. You can save a bogus file at the corresponding folder just to make things easy when you export the csv files.

- After processig each Sound object, remove it, as well as its newly created Formant and Pitch objects (may not be necessary but it's cleaner, right?)

- Have fun!
